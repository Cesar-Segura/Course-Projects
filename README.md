# Course-Projects
Contains the best projects I worked on in CPSC 112 

There are two separate projects in this repository:

SudokuSolver: takes a sample sudoku file with blanks left as zeros as input and outputs the solved sudoku puzzle in the terminal

ManufacturingSimulation: takes a simulation.txt file as input (contains amount of raw inputs, orders, percentage that a machine breaks down, etc) and outputs an animation that displays the raw inputs being transferred through a machine and coming out as the final product (notebooks and hangers). Uses object-oriented programming to complete tasks and store data.
